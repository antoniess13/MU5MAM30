For those that wish to use them, the included .tgz contains my :

- .vim (directory with some C/C++ related plugins)
- .vimrc (vim main configuration file)
- .bashrc (colorize some stuff and most importantly load tab completion
           capabilities)
- .clang-format (for C/C++ file auto-formatting, on save by default, in vim) 

To use them all : 

cp some_of_my_config.tgz ~
tar xvzf some_of_my_config.tgz
